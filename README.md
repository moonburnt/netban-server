# Netban Server

## Description

**Netban** - a moderation tool to restrict users per 'networks' of channels on
social media services. Made with a client-server architecture to support multiple
client nodes, with the ability to apply restrictions both globally and on
per-server basis - its designed to avoid all the tediousness of standard
moderation instruments, while keeping the ability to fine-tune restrictions
depending on each use-case scenario.

For now, only telegram moderation is officially supported, but the architecture
itself is not limited to it and may be updated for support of other messengers /
services, if there will be any interest.
